# Course Project for Getting and Cleaning Data #

We only need one script, run_analysis.R, in order to take all our data and create a tidy data set from it.

+ Lines 3-4 get the names for all the features (the data stored in X_test.txt, and X_train.txt).
+ Lines 6-11 open our data and names them.
+ Lines 17-21 take out all the features data we don't need.
